Welcome to my coding journey! 🎉 I'll be posting all the code I’m working on for the **Responsive Web Design Certification** from FreeCodeCamp here. 🖥️

## Course Overview
This course is designed to teach me the basics of building webpages using:

- [ ] **Technical Documentation Page** 📚 — A clean and organized page to display technical information.
- [ ] **Product Landing Page** 🛒 — A page to showcase a product in an engaging way.
- [ ] **Personal Portfolio Website** 🌟 — The project that brings everything together, showcasing all the skills I’ve learned.
